This is an implementation of ITU-T Recommendation G.722 for a DSP simulator.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|  1. move the test file to G.722/SNDfiles/ directory                     |
|                                                                         |
|  2. convert the format of the file from ulaw to linearPCM               |
|         eecg % convert -u test.au test.linearPCM                        |
|                                                                         |
|  3. convert the representation of the file from binary to ascii         |
|         eecg % binary2ascii -p test.linearPCM test.linearPCM.ascii      |
|                                                                         |
|  4. go to the QMF.transmit directory                                    |
|         eecg % cd ../QMF.transmit                                       |
|                                                                         |
|  5. remove the present "input.dsp" file and link the new test file      |
|         eecg % rm input.dsp                                             |
|         eecg % ln -s ../SNDfiles/test.linearPCM.ascii input.dsp         |
|                                                                         |

To only test the transmitting and receiving mechanisms execute
          testPassThruSUN      or
          testPassThruDSP

To test the whole system (i.e. transmit->compress->decompress->receive) execute
          test722SUN           or
          test722DSP

Note : The difference between SUN and DSP is...

       SUN - executes a sparc binary of the source code
             on the sparcstation
       DSP - simulates an intermediate representation 
             (looks like assembly code, but with VLIWs)
             of the source code on a DSP simulator

Unresolved Issues
=================

The ITU-T Standard for G.722 requires 16kHz sampled input files 
at 14 bits per sample.

      Unfortunately, all the available ulaw files ( .au files ) I
      could find were of the 8kHz variety. So, I have not been able to 
      verify this implementation.

      The utility I'm using to convert the format from ulaw to linearPCM
      only converts to 16 bit linearPCM not 14 bit linearPCM as 
      required by G.722... This implies that a significant amount of
      truncation is occuring before any compression is performed.
