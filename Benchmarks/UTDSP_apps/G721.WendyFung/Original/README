G.721 - adpcm-1.0 (DSP_c and GNU_c versions)
============================================

The apdcm encoder and decoder encodes and decodes voice-quality audio files.
The adpcm encoder compresses audio data using the CCITT G.721  ADPCM
voice data encoding scheme.  This data compression technique reduces the 
storage requirements of voice-quality audio data by  50%.  The adpcm decoder  
decodes ADPCM audio files to standard u-law audio format.

The adpcm encoder reads samples from the named audio files and encodes 
them  into  4-bit ADPCM codes.  The 4-bit codes are packed in bytes,
lower nibble first, and written to standard output, preceded by
an audio file header. 

The adpcm decoder reverses the processing of adpcm_enc  by  decoding
ADPCM  samples  from  the  named audio files.  The output is written
to the standard output as a u-law audio  data  file, doubling  the 
data storage requirements.

The CCITT G.721 ADPCM  algorithm  is  particularly  oriented towards 
encoding voice data.  If these programs are used to compress music 
or other types of sounds, there may  be  some degradation in the 
resulting signal quality.

The flow of inputs and outputs of each .c file are illustrated in
the following flowchart :-


            +-------+              +---------+       +-----+     +----------+
audio.au -->|convert|- audio.pcm ->|expandby2|------>|coder|---->|squeezeby8|
            +-------+   (short)    +---------+ (int) +-----+   | +----------+
                                                               |       |
                                               (direct pass    |       |
                                                for testing)   |       |
                                                               |       |
            +-------+              +----------+       +-------+   +---------+
audio.au <--|convert|<- audio.pcm -|squeezeby2|<------|decoder|<--|expandby8|
            +-------+   (short)    +----------+ (int) +-------+   +---------+



NOTE : "convert" is an executable file that can be executed at any time,
see usage below :

   ==================================================
   usage: convert -[u|p] source_file destination_file

          -u option to convert from ulaw to linearPCM
          -p option to convert from linearPCM to ulaw
   ==================================================


Command to test the program is :
   eecg % runADPCM audio
