This directory contains version 1.0 of a simple 16 bit PCM <-> 4 bit
ADPCM coder and decoder. See the source and the manpage for comments
on the algorithm.

The routines have been tested on an SGI Indigo running Irix 4.0.2 and
on a Sparcstation 1+ running SunOS 4.1.1.

On a Sun you should compile with -DNODIVMUL. The resulting code will
compress at 250Ksample/sec and decompress at 300Ksample/sec.

On an SGI you should compile *without* -DNODIVMUL, and the compressor
runs at 350Ksample/sec and the decompressor at 700Ksample/sec.

If you use this package I would like to hear from you.
I am especially interested in people who can test interoperability
with proven Intel/DVI ADPCM coders. I have tried to get the algorithm
correct, but you never know....
